URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web that enables the Uniform Resource Locator to be made considerably shorter and still direct to the desired page. This is done by using a redirect path to a web page that has a long URL.

The project is developed using Django for backend and HTML and CSS for frontend. 

## Usage
